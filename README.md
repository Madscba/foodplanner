# Foodplanner Data Pipeline

This project implements a data pipeline for Foodplanner using Snowflake and DBT (Data Build Tool). The pipeline is designed to process and transform raw data from various sources into a comprehensive, 360-degree view of users, subscriptions, payments, preferences, food plans, and recipes.

## Tools Used

- **Snowflake**: A cloud-based data warehousing platform used to store and manage the data.
- **DBT (Data Build Tool)**: A tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively.
